# DeckOfCards-BE

TODOS:

-   Get this thing hosted somewhere and update the links for the full route in the documentation page
-   Get Swagger set up for a real documentation page
-   Write tests and start working with replay stuff

-   Figure out how to enforce that only the server can call the submission route
-   Better error handling for login/registration routes in particular, as needed by FE team.
-   IF TIME ALLOWS: Run a service once per day deleting replays over 2 weeks old.
