# DeckOfCards-BE

TODOS:

Still getting updates from games that have already terminated when a player leaves ANOTHER game
Terminated games still have id of the player 1 (but not username), the rest of the fields are null

Why am I still getting updates for games that I left?
Why are those updates for games that are terminated?
Why is there a code and a playerNum along with the playerNumber
