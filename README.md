# DeckOfCards-BE

TODOS:

-   Test building and typescript conversion of previously-working code
-   Start working with actual socket server to get testing ready

-   Better error handling for login/registration routes in particular, as needed by FE team
-   IF TIME ALLOWS: Run a service once per day deleting replays over 2 weeks old
-   Finish working with FE team

-   Try again in the future to get PM2 working
    "pm2": "^5.2.0",
    "start": "pm2 start index.js --no-daemon"
